Problem statement
You have been given a 9x9 2d integer matrix 'MAT' representing a Sudoku puzzle. The empty cells of the Sudoku are filled with zeros, and the rest of the cells are filled with integers from 1 to 9. Your task is to fill all the empty cells such that the final matrix represents a Sudoku solution.

Note:
A Sudoku solution must satisfy all the following conditions-
1. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9, 3x3 sub-grids of the grid.

You can also assume that there will be only one sudoku solution for the given matrix
